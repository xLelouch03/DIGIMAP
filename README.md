## MCO
- To access the executable file, kindly proceed to the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rqbfg1ip_Ftxvo6M5-1zIJe_NtRCOgyM?usp=drive_link) and download both files.
- Make sure to keep the `animal_classifier.pth` and `app.exe` in the same directory to ensure that the app will run.

## To build the app
- Install PyInstaller through `pip install pyinstaller`
- Create the executable file with `pyinstaller --onefile app.py`
- Make sure that `animal_classifier.pth` is placed on the same directory as the `app.exe` (in dist/)
- The `animal_classifier.pth` can be generated by running the whole `super resolution.ipynb` notebook
