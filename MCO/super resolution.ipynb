    "The Animals-10 Dataset contains approximately 28,000 medium-quality images categorized into 10 classes: dog, cat, horse, spider, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, and elephant. These images were collected from Google Images and verified by humans, with some erroneous samples included to reflect real-world conditions, such as user-submitted images.\n",
