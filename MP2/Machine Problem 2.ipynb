    "The goal of the machine problem is to apply the concepts of color transformations, specifically using histogram equalization and gamma correction techniques. You are to submit two files for this activity: (1) a Jupyter notebook containing the solutions to the action items. Ensure you provide comments, discussions, and proper section divisions for your code. Please also include your answer to the Guide Questions in the Jupyter Notebook; (2) a PDF version of your Jupyter Notebook. You can provide a link to your submission resources or a zip file. The instructor will run it on their local machine, so make sure the codes and files are accessible and functional. "
